                        Hilltop Bakery began with a simple idea. Good bread should feel like home. Our team started
                        baking in a small kitchen overlooking a quiet hillside, inspired by the calm mornings, open
                        skies, and the joy that comes from sharing something warm and handmade. What began as a weekend
                        hobby soon turned into a community-driven bakery supported by friends, neighbors, and visitors
                        who believed in the value of honest food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to create fresh, rustic baked goods that bring people together. We focus on
                        small-batch methods, thoughtful ingredients, and familiar recipes that highlight the beauty of
                        simple flavors. Everything we make is shaped by hand, baked with patience, and served with care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Hilltop Bakery, we believe that a bakery should feel welcoming. We want every customer to
                        feel connected to our process, our ingredients, and our love for the craft. Whether you visit us
                        for your daily bread or a special treat, we hope our bakery becomes a small and comforting part
                        of your day.
